# Adjoint folds in Haskell


Adjoint folds generalize some operations very frequently used in the functional programming style (catamorphism, histomorphism, mutumpoprhism, etc..)
Ralf Hinze described them in his paper [Adjoint folds ans Unfolds](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/SSGIP10/AdjointFolds.pdf)

This repository showcases them.
Different encodings are used highlighting some feature of modern haskell and their tradeoff.


--- TBD 

# Theory

One has two ways to define adjoint folds.
way 1 
way 2

Their result is the same but not the computation leading to it

# Encodings and exemple 

## With ordinary haskell functors, aka endofucntors in Hask

## Between functor category [Hask, Hask] and Hask

## Bettween product category Hask * Hask and Hask

## Most general encoding in modern haskell

from Sjoerd

## Limits of haskell

# Mendler folds vs simple folds

weak recursion vs strong recursion
advantage in proof carrying code
